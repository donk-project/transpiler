# Donk Transpiler

The Donk Project Transpiler is set of Golang binaries which convert the core
Dreammaker API or a syntactically valid Dreammaker codebase into C++ source.

The Transpiler is currently *not API-stable*.

For more information on Donk Project, see https://blog.snowfrost.garden/1.

## Description

Once a binary proto representation of the Dreammaker codebase AST is generated,
it can be ingested by the **Parser**. The Parser makes the AST available to the
rest of the transpiler through the native types defined in it: DMProc, DMVar,
and so on.

Once parsed, a **Transformer** can be built, which walks the AST and transforms
the AST into a [Vasker][] proto. Finally, the transformer is passed to the
**Writer**, which uses text/template to write the output to a set of .cc and .h
files.

In the case of the core API, we rely on SpacemanDMM's description of reserved
names, objects, and procs, and generate a directory structure that allows for
maintainers to fill in the implementation. This is what's known as `donk/api`,
and is created via `coregen.go`.

Otherwise, the AST is generated by `main.go`, and attempts to parse the entirety
of the AST, including all code blocks, and producing the results into the
specified output path.
